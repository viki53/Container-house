# Shipping containers house

The idea here is to build a great and cheap custom house, using shipping containers as the main structural elements.

The current view uses five 40" and one 20" containers.

The plan has been made using Adobe Illustrator with an SVG export so it can be viewed anywhere.

Dimensions are at 1:100 scale so *1 cm* equals *1 m* (easy enough conversions).

# Inside the house

The current plan involves a simple house with big living spaces for a couple or a small family.

* 2 bedrooms
* 1 bathroom
* 1 toilet
* 1 closet
* 1 office (could become a bedroom)
* 1 living area with kitchen
* 1 big outdoor area surrounded by the house
